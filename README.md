# Hey, I'm Cooldev1337 👋

I mess around with low-level stuff, break down bytecode for fun, and build tools for devs *and* non-devs — because everyone should be able to poke around in the guts of tech, not just the people who know how to code.

## 🛠️ EVM Bytecode Disassembler


I built a tool to help you take apart EVM bytecode, opcode by opcode. It’s lightweight, fast, and makes reverse engineering smart contracts way more accessible.

## </> GasGauge Remix IDE Plugin

This plugin takes the Remix gas calculations and enhances them by giving you the total price cost of executing your smart contract functions.  
It offers the flexibility to adjust the priority fee percentiles used for the different speeds (Slow, Medium, and Fast) in the EIP-1559 calculation.  
It also enables you to select from 48 different fiat currencies to display the transaction cost, or you can choose to show the cost in the native gas token.  
  
To test it, go to the Remix Plugin Manager and press "Connect to an external plugin".  
Then enter GasGuage as the plugin name and display name.  
In the url field, paste this:  
https://gasgauge-remix-ide-plugin-cooldev1337.pages.dev/  
**(This link works only as a Remix IDE plugin. It will not work when accessed directly from the browser)**
  
And hit "OK".

## 🧪 What I Like Working On

- Blockchain internals & tooling
- Smart contract weirdness
- Reverse engineering stuff that wasn't meant to be read
- Making complex systems make sense
