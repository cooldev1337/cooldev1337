# Hey, I'm Cooldev1337 👋

I mess around with low-level stuff, break down bytecode for fun, and build tools for devs *and* non-devs — because everyone should be able to poke around in the guts of tech, not just the people who know how to code.

## 🛠️ EVM Bytecode Disassembler


I built a tool to help you take apart EVM bytecode, opcode by opcode. It’s lightweight, fast, and makes reverse engineering smart contracts way more accessible.

## 🧪 What I Like Working On

- Blockchain internals & tooling
- Smart contract weirdness
- Reverse engineering stuff that wasn't meant to be read
- Making complex systems make sense
